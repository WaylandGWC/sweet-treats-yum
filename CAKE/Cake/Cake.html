Ingredients<br>

3 pt. coffee gelato, such as Talenti Coffee Chocolate Chip<br>
2 c. strongly brewed coffee<br>
1/3 c. dark rum<br>
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
36 Ladyfinger cookies<br>
1/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder, for garnish<br>
2 tbsp. chocolate curls, for garnish<br>

 
Directions
Set out ice cream to soften slightly, 10 minutes.<br>
Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl, whisk together coffee, rum, and vanilla.<br>
Transfer ice cream to a medium bowl and stir until smooth and spreadable.<br>

In a 9"x13" pan, spread one pint of the coffee ice cream in a single layer.<br>
Dip each lady finger in coffee mixture and lay in an even layer on top of ice cream, cutting lady fingers if needed.<br>
Repeat with another layer of ice cream and another layer of cookies.<br>
Finish with a layer of ice cream, cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to refreeze, 3 hours up to overnight.<br>

When ready to serve, dust with cocoa powder and sprinkle with shaved chocolate.<br>
Run a knife under hot water and dry, then slice into squares and serve.<br>
