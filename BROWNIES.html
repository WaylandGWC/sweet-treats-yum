   Reese's Stuffed Brownies <br>
      INGREDIENTS<br>
  1 1/4 c. all-purpose flour<br>
1 tsp. kosher salt<br>
1/4 c. unsweetened cocoa<br>
1 1/2 c. chocolate chips<br>
1 c. unsalted butter, cut into 1 inch pieces<br>
1 1/2 c. granulated sugar<br>
1/2 c. packed light brown sugar<br>
5 eggs, at room temperature<br>
2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
12 Reese's, unwrapped<br>
DIRECTIONS<br>
Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter the inside of 9”-×-13” inch baking pan and line with parchment paper.<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and cocoa powder.<br>
Set a large heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water to create a double-boiler.<br>
Add the butter and the chocolate chips to the bowl. Heat, stirring occasionally until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and smooth.<br>
Turn off the heat, then whisk in the sugars and stir until combined.<br>
Remove bowl from heat.<br>
Add the eggs one at a time, stirring well between each addition.<br>
Stir in vanilla.<br> 
Sprinkle the flour mixture over the chocolate mixture and fold in the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until just combined.<br>
Pour the batter into parchment paper-lined baking pan then press the whole peanut butter cups into the batter.<br>
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 30 minutes.<br>
Let cool completely in the pan. Cut into squares and serve at room temperature.<br>

    S'mores Brownies *Credits to Delish.com, visit them for more amazing recipes like this one!*
  <br>
    Ingredients:
    
    - One box of brownie batter (You will need ALL of the items that the brownie batter box calls for)
    <br>
    - One cup of Marshmallow fluff
    <br>
    - 30 mini marshamllows
    <br>
    - 2 tbsp chocolate fudge
    <br>
    - graham crackers (for garnish, so they're an optional finishing touch!)
    <br>
    <br>
    Directions:
    <p>
    <br>
  First, you're going to preheat the oven to 350º F, and then line an 8 by 8 pan with parchment paper.
    
    <br>
    
  Next, you'll prepare the brownies as the recipe that comes with your brownie batter says, pour the brownie batter in the prepared, and lined
  pan, then bake the brownies in the oven for however long the brownie instructions on the box says to.
  
    <br>
    
  After the brownies are baked, wait for them to cool slightly then take the back of a spoon and book holes all along the brownies, <br>leaving small spaces between the holes.
    Take the Marshmallow fluff, and pour some into a microwavable bowl, <br>and microwave it until it's liquid, be sure not to burn it! Pour the marshmallow fluff all over the 
    brownies, and spread it over the brownies in an even layer.
  
  <br>
    
  Then, take a generous amount of mini marshmallows and sprinkle them all over the marshmallow fluff.
    
  <br>
    Next, you're going to broil the brownies, heat the broiler, and broil the brownies until the marshmallows are golden, <br>
    this should take about one minute.
    
   <br>
    
    These last steps are optional, but they definitely complete the s'more brownie, take some chocolate fudge and pour some into <br>
    a microwavable bowl, microwave it until it's liquid, drizzle it all over the golden marshmallows. 
    <br>
    Lastly, take some graham crackers, and smash them! When they're crumbs, just sprinkle them all over the brownies.
     <br>
      Now you're done! Enjoy!
