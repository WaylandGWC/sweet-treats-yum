Heavenly Hash Donuts <br>
Ingredients <br>

1 recipe Quick Bread Dough -or- Pillsbury Grands Biscuits <br>
4 cups vegetable oil for frying <br>
2 cups chocolate chips <br>
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream <br>
2 cups marshmallow cream <br>
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips <br>
1/2 cup chocolate syrup <br>
8 small brownies <br>

Instructions <br>

Heat the oil in a 2 quart pot over medium - low heat (closer to medium than low). <br>
Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a donut cutter or a 4-5 inch round cookie cutter to cut the dough (of course, you can skip this step if you're using the Pillsbury shortcut!). Be sure to cut out the center hole so that you don't risk having a dough center! You should get about 8 donuts.<br>
Carefully fry each donut by placing the dough into the oil (you'll know it's ready when it bubbles a little when you drop a couple of drops of water in it). I only fried one at a time. <br>
Let the dough fry on the first side for 1-2 minutes until golden brown, then flip. Allow to fry for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oil and place on a wire rack layered with paper towels (to soak up excess oil). <br>
Microwave the 2 cups chocolate chips and whipping cream for 1 minute. Stir until smooth and thick. Spoon the chocolate on top of each donut. <br>
Microwave the marshmallow cream for about 30 seconds, until a little melty (you just want it to be easy to spoon). Spoon a HEAPING tablespoon of marshmallow cream over each donut (don't worry about spreading or swirling). <br
Crumble a brownie over each donut, pressing the chunks into the marshmallow cream and chocolate. This will mix the cream and chocolate together a little bit for a "swirled" effect. <br>
Sprinkle mini chocolate chips over top, and drizzle with chocolate syrup.
Serve immediately or serve in an air tight container.
