Heavenly Hash Donuts <br>
Ingredients <br><br>

1 recipe Quick Bread Dough -or- Pillsbury Grands Biscuits <br>
4 cups vegetable oil for frying <br>
2 cups chocolate chips <br>
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream <br>
2 cups marshmallow cream <br>
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips <br>
1/2 cup chocolate syrup <br>
8 small brownies <br>

Instructions <br>

Heat the oil in a 2 quart pot over medium - low heat (closer to medium than low). <br>
Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a donut cutter or a 4-5 inch round cookie cutter to cut the dough (of course, you can skip this step if you're using the Pillsbury shortcut!).<br> 
Be sure to cut out the center hole so that you don't risk having a dough center! You should get about 8 donuts.<br>
Carefully fry each donut by placing the dough into the oil (you'll know it's ready when it bubbles a little when you drop a couple of drops of water in it).<br>
I only fried one at a time. <br>
Let the dough fry on the first side for 1-2 minutes until golden brown, then flip.<br> 
Allow to fry for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.<br>
Remove from the oil and place on a wire rack layered with paper towels (to soak up excess oil). <br>
Microwave the 2 cups chocolate chips and whipping cream for 1 minute.<br>
Stir until smooth and thick. Spoon the chocolate on top of each donut. <br>
Microwave the marshmallow cream for about 30 seconds, until a little melty (you just want it to be easy to spoon).<br>
Spoon a HEAPING tablespoon of marshmallow cream over each donut (don't worry about spreading or swirling). <br
Crumble a brownie over each donut, pressing the chunks into the marshmallow cream and chocolate.<br>
This will mix the cream and chocolate together a little bit for a "swirled" effect. <br>
Sprinkle mini chocolate chips over top, and drizzle with chocolate syrup.<br>
Serve immediately or serve in an air tight container.<br><br><br>
