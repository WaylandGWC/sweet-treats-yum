    S'more pumpkins cupcakes<br>
      <br>
    
    
     Ingredients<br>
3 c. graham cracker crumbs (about 20 full graham cracker sheets), plus more for garnish<br>
12 tbsp. butter, melted<br>
2 tbsp. sugar<br>
pinch of kosher salt<br>
1 box vanilla cake mix, plus ingredients called for on box<br>
1 15-oz. can pumpkin purée<br>
1 11-oz. bag chocolate chips<br>
3/4 c. heavy cream<br>
12 marshmallows<br>
  <br>
Directions<br>
     <br>
 
Preheat oven to 350º and line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.<br>
Meanwhile, combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Press about 1 tablespoon of the mixture into each cupcake liner to make mini crusts.<br>
In a large mixing bowl, combine the vanilla cake mix with canned pumpkin. Top graham cracker crusts with batter.<br>
Bake until a toothpick inserted into cupcakes comes out clean, 22 minutes.<br>
Let cool slightly while you make ganache: Add chocolate chips to a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over low heat, heat heavy cream just until it bubbles. Pour over chocolate chips and let stand 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.<br>
Top each cupcake with a spoonful of ganache, letting some drip down the sides, then add a marshmallow and return to oven. Bake until marshmallow is golden, about 5 minutes more.<br>
Garnish with graham cracker crumbs.
